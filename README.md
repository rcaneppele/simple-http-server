# Simple Http Server

A basic http server using Java.
It's only for teaching TDD, not a real http server :)

## Running

Just run the **Server** main class, and then send http requests for **localhost:5050**. This can be done by using a Web Browser like Google Chrome, or using an app like **curl**

Made using JUnit and Sockets.
